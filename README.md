# What An Adventure - A Milestone Project


AM I RESPOSIVE IMAGE TO GO HERE 


My third milestone project, undertaken as part of the Code Institutes Diploma in Software Development. 
Here is the link for [What An Adventure]()


# Who Is This Game For?

This game has been created for those who enjoy games where there are multiple choices leading to 


# UX - User Experience

The project was planned in 5 stages. 

- Strategy Plane 

- Scope Plane 

- Structure Plane

- Skeleton Plane

- Surface Plane 


# The Strategy Plane

# The Surface Plane 

# Technologies used
 
- [Github]( https://github.com/) to keep the file 
- [Gitpod]( https://www.gitpod.io/) for version control


# Resources
- [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) Course material
- [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) Slack community 
- [W3Schools]( https://www.w3schools.com/) 
- [PEP8]()

- [Am I Responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/) â€“ Check the sites responsiveness
- [Stack Overflow]()


# Testing

# Responsiveness 

I checked the website's responsiveness using Google Chrome Dev Tools. Mobile, tablet and desktop sizes were tested, and all worked well. 
It also responded on each breakpoint that were set up on Media Query's and no visual or functional errors found



# Version Control 

- GitHub
- Gitpod

Gitpod served as the local repository and IDE. 
GitHUb served as the remote repository. 

The following steps were followed to maintain version control;

- I created a repository on GitHub and named it 'What An Adventure' 
- I then signed in to Gitpod and opened a new workspace via the repository name 'What An Adventure'
- I created the pages, folders and files on GitPod
- I saved my work on GitPod at regular intervals and pushed it to GitHub to keep it safe

This is the process I followed having completing each significant section of code, I typed the following into the terminal:
- git add . (This added the work to git)
- git commit -m "commit message" (This committed the work)
- git push (This pushed the work to GitHub)



# Deployment 

I followed the below steps on GitHub to deploy the website. 

- Go to repository and select 'settings'. 
- Under the 'Github pages@ section, click on the live link. 
- On "Source", select "Branch: main' for Branch and click save.
- The website is now published on GitHub Pages and the link is provided on the same section




## Reminders

* Your code must be placed in the `run.py` file
* Your dependencies must be placed in the `requirements.txt` file
* Do not edit any of the other files or your code may not deploy properly

## Creating the Heroku app

When you create the app, you will need to add two buildpacks from the _Settings_ tab. The ordering is as follows:

1. `heroku/python`
2. `heroku/nodejs`

You must then create a _Config Var_ called `PORT`. Set this to `8000`

Connect your GitHub repository and deploy as normal.
